Project Overview

**Project Description**

Your task is to create your very own single-page personal web portfolio! For this part, you will first create a responsive layout for your page using CSS grid.

**Project Checklist**

A base project should contain **all **of the following:

* Portfolio must have **at least** the following sections, organized however you like:

    * Navigation menu: A way for someone to easily navigate to sections of your page.

    * Banner: Your name at the top, big and proud! Also a good idea to put your title somewhere near your name (e.g., "Front-End Web Designer", “Digital Artist”, “Game Developer”, etc.). 

    * About: In just a few sentences, introduce yourself to the world! You may add a photo of yourself here if you’d like.

    * Experience: Think of a baseball card. What are some portfolio-relevant facts about you? Languages you speak, programming languages you know, awards you’ve received…

    * Projects: For now, just link to projects you’ve already done. If you don’t have links, it’s fine to just have an empty link as a placeholder. 

    * Contact: This is just a placeholder for now, so you can add a "Coming soon!" paragraph and leave it at that.

    * Footer: The very bottom of the page. For now, you can just add a "Site Designed by [Your Name]" paragraph here.

* Portfolio must use a **CSS grid layout**. 

**Project Challenges**

Make a statement with your project by taking on one of the following challenges.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
Apply flexbox to each section of your grid! You can find out how to do this in the "bonus" section of the slide deck! </td>
    <td>
Create your own grid layout for your page! You don’t have to use ours! Make one even better!</td>
    <td>
Complete all stages of CSS Grid Garden and apply any of the techniques you learned there to your page! Hint: instead of using “grid-template-columns” and “grid-template-rows”, you can just use “grid-template” and save some space... the game teaches you how!</td>
  </tr>
